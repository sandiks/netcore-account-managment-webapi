# netcore-account-managment-webapi
We have a fictitious scenario where we'd like to build an API to manage Zip Pay users. We require
the ability to create, get, and list users. Once we create users, we need the ability for the user to
create an account.

This should be implemented with an API and database.

Business Requirements:
* Should not allow more than one user with the same email address
* Zip Pay allows credit for up to $1000, so if monthly salary - monthly expenses is less than
$1000 we should not create an account for the user and return an error

Tech stack requirements:
API: Your choice!
DB: Your choice!
We'd recommend using docker/docker-compose to stand this up, but if you'd like to use something
else, that's okay too :)

API requirements
1. The following Endpoints are required:

**Create user**

* Fields to be provided and persist
* Name
* Email Address (Must be unique)
* Monthly Salary (Must be a positive number - for simplicity, pretend there is
no such thing as income tax)
* Monthly Expenses (Must be a positive number)

**List users**

**Get user**

**Create an account**

* Given a user, create an account
* Should take into account the business requirements above
* Up to you to decide the appropriate fields to persist here

**List Accounts**

2. Should be robust and include relevant response codes for different scenarios
3. No need to implement any kind of auth for this test

Database requirements
1. Users and accounts should persist to a database of your choice
